# 6-months-cybersecurity-analyst-roadmap
  🛡️This repository tracks my journey to become a Cybersecurity Analyst over the next 6 months.
It includes daily/weekly exercises, labs, mini-projects, and hands-on practice with tools, networks, and security concepts.

### This repository will contain:

💻 Networking Labs – Subnetting, IP addressing, OSI/TCP-IP model exercises

🥽 Cisco Packet Tracer Labs – LAN/WAN setup, routing, DHCP, ping tests

📫 Email Server Simulation – Setting up local email servers and testing communication

🚥 Traffic Analysis Exercises – Using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic

📄 Vulnerability Assessments – Scanning and analyzing virtual machines for security issues

🧪 Incident Response Labs – Examining logs, identifying threats, and simulating responses
